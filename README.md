# Tap Code Receiver App

Mobile app which receives tap codes and decode it into plain text.

#### What is a Tap Code?
The tap code, sometimes called the knock code, is a way to encode text messages on a letter-by-letter basis in a very simple way. The message is transmitted using a series of tap sounds, hence its name, which in the case of this app, is a series of flashes. The tap code has been commonly used by prisoners to communicate with each other.
